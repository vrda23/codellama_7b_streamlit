# codellama_7b_streamlit
This project demonstrates the use of Codellama-7b specialized language model for coding assistanceâ€”integrated into a Streamlit app. Users can input queries related to coding problems, and the model will return helpful code snippets and related details.

NOTE: This model can be run via CPU from a desktop computer. You just need to download the model to the same directory where the script is located.
